# numpadiOS
An application that allows you to use your iPhone as a numpad for a computer!

**Currently a WIP**

# Why?

I made this iOS application because I needed an *ad-free* iPhone numpad that would allow me to use my iPhone as a numpad for my computer.

# Q&A

**Q : How does it work?**

*A : It works with LAN and node.JS. Make sure your computer and your phone are connected on the same network. Please also follow in-app setup instrinctions*

**Q : Does it work with macOS or Linux ?**

*A : Yes ! Windows, macOS and Linux are supported ! (Note : It might not work properly on every linux distro)*

**Q : Will it be available on the App Store ?**

*A : Yes, it will be as a free app.*
