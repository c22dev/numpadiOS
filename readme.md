# iOSNumpad
An application that allows you to use your iPhone as a numpad for a computer!

**Currently a WIP**

# Q&A

**Q : How will it work?**

*A : It is planned to work over USB.*

**Q : Does it work with macOS or Linux ?**

*A : Not yet.*

**Q : Will it be available on the App Store ?**

*A : Yes, it will be as a free app.*
